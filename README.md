# odin-recipes
This project is to help develop my HTML skills that I have learned in the Odin Project by creating a recipes website. Here I will practice creating a webpage by implementing anchors, headers, lists, and linking other pages into my recipe webpage. 

I will use one of my favorite foods as my subject: Tortilla Española. 

Things that I would like to fix:
- Fix the pictures so that they would all be the same size
- Add styling to the index page to make it more user fiendly
- Add YouYube videos of the meals
